# Jupyter Notebooks for illustrating use of the NSF's OIR Lab Astro Data Archive APIs

## API How-To notebooks

- [Advanced Search ](advanced-search.ipynb)
- [Simple Image Access](sia.ipynb)
- [API Authentication](api-authentication.ipynb)

These notebooks focus on the API (Application Programming Interface)
for the [NOIRLab Astro Data Archive](https://astroarchive.noao.edu/api/docs/).
Using this API as part of a science work
flow is (mostly) beyond the scope of these notebooks. 

## Science example notebooks

- [Making an exposure map for DES](exposure-map.ipynb)

This notebook borrows from the API How-To notebooks to show how they might be used for a specific science purpose.  More such notebboks will be added in the future.
