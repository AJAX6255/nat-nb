# Jupyter Notebooks for illustrating use of the NSF's OIR Lab Astro Data Archive APIs

- [Advanced Search ](advanced-search.ipynb)
- [Simple Image Access](sia.ipynb)
- [API Authentication](api-authentication.ipynb)

These notebooks focus on the API (Application Programming Interface)
for the [NOIRLab Astro Data Archive](https://astroarchive.noao.edu/api/docs/).
Using this API as part of a science work
flow is (mostly) beyond the scope of these notebooks.
